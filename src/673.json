      "We had our first virtual event a couple of days ago. I was really happy to see that more than 25 people joined. We also have the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mh9kx-Swx74\">video recordings of Getting started with Docker for Perl developers</a>. Please watch, click on the thumbs-up and follow the channel!",

I'd like to encourage you to register to the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens\">Code-Mavens group</a> an to the event itself. I would be also happy to get requests for topics to cover.",
      "On the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/events\">events page of the Perl Weekly</a> you can now see all the Perl-related events we know about. It also features a calendar you can add to Google calendar or whatever other program you use to see the events along with your own events.",
      "The closest of all those events is <a href=\"https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las/\">The Perl and Raku conference</a> that starts a week from today. It is still not too late to register and to use it as an excuse to go to Las Vegas... You could, of course also sponsor the conference...",
      "Another one of the big in-person events is the <a href=\"http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/\">London Perl and Raku Workshop</a> that will take place in October. There you still have time to submit a talk proposal or to offer your sponsorship.",
